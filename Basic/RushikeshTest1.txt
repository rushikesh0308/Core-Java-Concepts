1. What is Jvm ,Jre,Jdk [1]
	-JVM stands for java virtual machine and it is used to run java program on machine
	-JRE is java runtime environment consists of JVM and some Library files. eg. jar files
	-JDK (java development kit) is combination of JRE and development tools like javac.

2. Why java is called as platform independent language?[1]
	-In java, After compilation source code is converted into byte code.
	-byte code is nothing but .class file
	-to run this byte code, we need JRE
	-byte code runs on any platform where JRE is installed.
	-Hence Java is platform independent.

3. WAP to take any two numbers from user and swap it without third variable[1]

	import java.util.Scanner;
	public class SwapNumber{
	public static void main(String[] args){
	Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
	int n1,n2;
	System.out.println("Enter first number");
	n1=sc.nextInt();//10
	System.out.println("Enter second number");
	n2=sc.nextInt();//5
	n1=n1+n2;//15
	n2=n1-n2;//15-5=10
	n1=n1-n2;//15-10=5
	System.out.println(n1);//10
	System.out.println(n2);//5
}
}
4. WAP to take any three numbers and find max number[1]
	import java.util.Scanner;
	public class MaxNumber{
	public static void main(String[] args){
	Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
	int n1,n2,n3;
	System.out.println("Enter first number");
	n1=sc.nextInt();
	System.out.println("Enter second number");
	n2=sc.nextInt();
	System.out.println("Enter third number");
	n3=sc.nextInt();
	if(n1>n2 && n1>n3){
		System.out.println(n1+" is greater");
	}else if(n2>n1 && n2>n3){
		System.out.println(n2+" is greater");
	}else{
		System.out.println(n3+" is greater");
	}
}
}
5. WAP to take number from user and find whether it is divisible 7 or not. If it is not divisible by 
7 then check which number should in that number ,so that number become divisible by zero
[1]
	import java.util.Scanner;
	public class Divisibility{
	public static void main(String[] args){
	Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
	int num,rem=0;
	System.out.println("Enter number");
	num=sc.nextInt();//23
	if(num%7==0){
		System.out.println(num+" is divisible by 7");
	}else{
		rem=num%7;//23%7=2
		num=num+(7-rem);//num=23+(7-2)=28
		System.out.println("We need to add:"+(7-rem));
	}
}
}
6. Find output[5]
a-Compile Time Error(int type in if block(boolean required));
b-GO
c-Compile Time Error(More than one statement in if block)
d-UNKNOWN
e-FOREST
